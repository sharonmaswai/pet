    <h1>The cat ate my homework</h1>
    <p>My cat Penny has this thing where it gets excited with a single object and for the next couple of hours it will focus solely on that object. This time the focus of Penny's attention was my assignment. I swear that cat does not take anything else other than cat food so I can't understand how it developed an appetite for paper.</p>
    <p>What I can say is that my assignment is sitting in a mound of cat refuse and I cannot seem to find an excuse to give my lecturer.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the things I may say:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The dog ate my homework (a classic)</li>
      <li>The cat ate my homework.</li>
      <li>I misplace the assignment.</li>
    </ul>
